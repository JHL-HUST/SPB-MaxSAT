Rethinking the Soft Conflict Pseudo Boolean Constraint on MaxSAT Local Search Solvers
----
This repository contains the codes of the SPB-MaxSAT algorithm for the MaxSAT proposed in our paper: <br> <br>
[Rethinking the Soft Conflict Pseudo Boolean Constraint on MaxSAT Local Search Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10589) <br>
Jiongzhi Zheng, Zhuo Chen, Chu-Min Li, Kun He <br> <br>

Supported Format
----
SPB-MaxSAT currently supports the format of instances for MaxSAT Evaluations before 2022.

To understand the format supported by SPB-MaxSAT, please refer to the MaxSAT Evaluation 2022 rules
(https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2022/rules.html#input).

Format Conversion
----
You can use the code available here (https://bitbucket.org/fbacchus/maxsat_benchmarks_code_base/src/master/) to convert new format to the old format.
